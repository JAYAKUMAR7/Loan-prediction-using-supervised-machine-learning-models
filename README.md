# Loan-prediction-using-supervised-machine-learning-models
Prediction of loan by verifying all the satisfactory constraints to be done for loan approval by using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Supervised machine learning used in the project:
         -> Decision Tree
         -> Random Forest
         -> XG Boost
         -> Logistic Regression
        
Outcome of the project:
      Accuracy value of all the models and it's respective AUC curves.
